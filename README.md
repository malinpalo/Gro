## Agile methodology
The Agile Methodology was employed throughout this project based on user stories. A github issue was created for each user story. A github working board was created to keep track on the user stories and to organize the work. Milestones (Iterations) was created to represent the products backlog. All user stories were added to the backlog.

### User stories 
User stories where created in the initial design phase based on my wireframes.
User stories required to implement each iteration were created. These were categorised according to whether they were 'must have' features required to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). [Gro GitHub Issues](https://github.com/issues).

### Iterations
Milestones was created as Iterations to be able to organize userstories and time used for each user story. [Gro GitHub Iterations](https://github.com/malinpalo?tab=projects).
